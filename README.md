# Map of Perl 6 Routines and Classes

Online version for Rakudo implementation:
    [map.perl6.party](https://map.perl6.party)

# Building / Viewing

1. Run `zef --depsonly install .` to install dependencies.
2. Run `./mapper.p6` to generate `map.json` file that include mapping data.
3. Run `./bin/viewer.p6` to start the local viewing web server
4. Visit [http://localhost:3000/](http://localhost:3000/) to view the map

If you got appropriate permissions, to sync data with map.perl6.party website,
run `./update-map.perl6.party` script. Note: the viewer server needs to be
running at the time.

If you're doing development on the viewer, you may find it handy to start
it with `./morbo.p6 bin/viewer.p6` that will auto-restart the server when
detecting any changes to the source code.
